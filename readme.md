**A Blockchain-Based Room Allocation System for Dormitories**

## 🧭 Overview

Room allocation in dormitories often leads to situations where students are assigned rooms they may not prefer, even though others may have rooms they would like to exchange. Dorm Ledger provides a decentralized solution that enables students to securely and fairly exchange rooms using blockchain technology.

The system ensures:
1. The final room allocation is optimal for everyone.
2. No student is worse off after the exchange.
3. No group of students can independently arrange a better swap outside the system.

## 💡 Features

- 📊 **Optimized Allocation**: Achieves the best possible arrangement for all students.
- 🤝 **Fairness Guaranteed**: Each student either improves their situation or remains equally satisfied.
- 🔐 **Blockchain Security**: Ensures tamper-proof, decentralized tracking of all exchanges.
- ⚙️ **Smart Contracts**: Automates exchanges based on predefined, transparent rules.
- 📁 **Full Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded and verifiable.

## 🛠️ Smart Contract

This project includes a Solidity smart contract (`contract_template.sol`) which powers the exchange logic. It ensures that only valid, beneficial exchanges occur and handles execution transparently for all participants.
